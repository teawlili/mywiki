::: note

`[dir]` is a parameter here, place it with real folder names, such as `docs`, `src` or other name you like.

::: tip

You can omit the `.md` extension, and paths ending with `/` are inferred as `/README.md`.

:::

---

::: tip Advanced usage of activeMatch

`activeMatch` gives you the ability to control whether the path is active, for example you may have the following dropdown:

- `/path/`
- `/path/a/`
- `/path/b/`

But you may have multiple folders with files under `/path/`. To avoid mutiple dropown items been actived under route starting with `/path/a/` or `/path/b/`, you can set `activeMatch` option for the first item with `^/path/(?:(?!a/|b/).*)?$`.
